V1.01
Fixed all the docking ports.
Re-pass over the Science lab - but it's legs also have issues like the Ranger. For now, as long as you don't launch it with it'scaled
legs deployed it seems fine.
Added KIS container space to the Ranger and Lander (if you have KIS installed).
Re-balanced the Ranger and Lander centre of mass and centre of lift and engine thrusters to hopefully make them much more stable.

V1.00
Fixed Blocked Hatch on Ranger - Ranger now has a Ranger Docking port built-in. Fixed blocked hatches on a bunch of other parts (thanks KSP 1.1).
Fixed alignment of all Internals with externals to support stock overlay mode. Due to this some internals and externals have been re-scaled and
re-done. Props also have had to change to fit. Added stock overlay mode meshes for internals.
Tweaked CoM and CoL on the lander, hopefully it flies better now in atmosphere.
Added support for JSIAdvTransparentPods (separate download mod see OP for link) on the Viper, Ranger and Lander.
Fixed VTOL engines for the Lander.
Modified the Endurance ring to have attach nodes on the outside of the ring to allow you to attach new docking nodes.
Added new Endurance Ring docking parts: "Endurance Outer Docking Node" and "Endurance Outer Ranger Docking Node"
Known Issues: Ranger Landing legs sink into the ground - I am unable to find a reliable way to fix this and many have had issues with landing
legs. Assume further updates to KSP will provide fixes for this. For now it is what it is.

V0.93
Fixed Texture on Lander - Specular.
Added Attach nodes to the top and bottom of the Lander.
Fixed RCS ports on Lander and Ranger.
Fixed Docking Nodes, they no attach/detach and have "Control from here".
It is now possible to build the entire Endurance without any Sub-Assemblies. Tip for attaching the docking nodes:
Hold Alt/Option key when placing them, continue holding Alt/Option and rotate them the right way. If they are not green 
move the mouse outwards a little bit until they turn green and release. Should attach nicely. For the Ranger angled ports
first attach docking nodes to a Straight attach point on the ring centre. Attach two Docking nodes the right way around and
then attach the Ranger. Then select the innermost docking port and place it on the angled attach node.

V0.92
Fixed collider on Ranger docking port part.
Fixed RCS transforms on the Ranger and Lander.
Fixed Landing legs on the Ranger - using custom part module adapted from SSTU mod (with permission).
Added AVC version checking support.

V0.91 
Fixed Thermals.
Fixed colliders. Fixed Models. Fixed textures.
Fixed CoM on Lander and Ranger.
Tweaked Lander dry mass to take into account engines.
Added Life Support configs for USI-LS and TAC-LS.
Added Connected Living Space configs.
Added KAS configs.
Heaps (lost count) of config file changes to get everything to work in KSP 1.0.5.
Added Emissives to the Landers VTOL engines.
New Ranger textures (courtesy of xxhansonmaxx).
Consolidated the Implementation folder so all textures and models are in an Assets Folder (with exception of the IVAs).
All the Endurance main modules that have Solar panels on their outside - the Solar Panels now ACTUALLY WORK and produce EC.
Updated the Colony Science Lab to the new KSP 1.0.5 science lab process of data and science.
Fixed Ranger multi-mode engines to work in KSP 1.0.5.
Inflatable ground habitat now has zero capacity when not inflated and 10 when inflated (using Porkjet's module).
