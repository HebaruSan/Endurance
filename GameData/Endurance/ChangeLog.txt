V0.93
Fixed Texture on Lander - Specular.
Added Attach nodes to the top and bottom of the Lander.
Fixed RCS ports on Lander and Ranger.
Fixed Docking Nodes, they no attach/detach and have "Control from here".
It is now possible to build the entire Endurance without any Sub-Assemblies. Tip for attaching the docking nodes:
Hold Alt/Option key when placing them, continue holding Alt/Option and rotate them the right way. If they are not green 
move the mouse outwards a little bit until they turn green and release. Should attach nicely. For the Ranger angled ports
first attach docking nodes to a Straight attach point on the ring centre. Attach two Docking nodes the right way around and
then attach the Ranger. Then select the innermost docking port and place it on the angled attach node.
